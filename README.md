# Machine Learning Exam Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Data Analytics 1 – Statistics & Machine Learning exam for the Master’s in Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence program.
It focuses on building, evaluating and interpreting multiple machine learning models across both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.

The end-to-end workflow includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing & scaling
- Model training for regression, classification & clustering
- Time-series forecasting using Prophet
- Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics
- Visualizations & insights

The repository includes the complete notebook, final project report and exam presentation slides for clarity and reproducibility.

## Key Features
- Fully reproducible ML pipeline
- Multiple modeling approaches (Regression, Classification, Clustering)
- Feature scaling, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and imputation
- Time-series forecasting using Prophet
- Visualization of model performance & clusters
- Clean and well-structured Colab environment
